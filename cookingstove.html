    <p>Rural women are adopting innovative cooking technologies to reduce reliance on firewood and preserve land resources.</p>
    <p>Innovations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy-Efficient Stoves: Using less firewood, reducing the pressure on forests. </li>
      <li>Briquettes from natural vegetation like wetlands: Currently we are experimenting anaerobic digestion technology in collaboration with the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
      This innovation will carbonize organic matter such as papyrus reeds.</li>
    </ul>
