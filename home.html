    <h1>EMPOWERING RURAL WOMEN. TURNING DREAMS INTO REALITY.</h1>

    <h3>BIRINGO WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (BIWODA) </h3>
   <p>Biringo Women Development Association (BIWODA) is a group of rural
women who formally collectively came together for a development course
in 2014. BIWODA is found in Buramba- Rwemihanga parishes
Rubaya- Kahungye Sub Counties, one of the sub counties that make up
Kabale District in south western Uganda. (Biringo is a rural area away from
the district headquarters [Kabale]. Owing to its remoteness, there are no
infrastructures and the social services in general which makes the area one
of the most disadvantaged/hard to reach areas in Kabale district.) Women
in Biringo community, like any other women in rural Uganda are the bread
winners of their families but are the most disadvantaged class of the
population with regard to income generation. Families in Biringo community
have an average 6 members per family and family daily income is less than
2000 Ugx. These families depend on subsistence farming. Land in Kabale
district being scarce, household have limited pieces of land on which they
cultivate their crops for home consumption.
The women of Biringo are hardworking and resilient but have been trapped
in a cycle of poverty for generations. With no access to formal employment,
they rely entirely on the land to survive.</p>
