    <p>In Uganda, rural women like in Biringo village bear the heaviest burden of poverty and societal neglect. 
      With limited access to education and economic opportunities, these women often face immense challenges in their day-to-day lives.
    <ul>
      <li>Illiteracy Levels- Nearly 1 in 3 women in rural areas are illiterate, restricting their ability to access information, 
        secure meaningful employment, or advocate for themselves.</li>
      <li>Subsistence Farming- Most rural women depend on subsistence agriculture for survival, 
        growing just enough food to feed their families but earning little or no income.</li>
      <li>Family Burdens- On average, rural women give birth to at least six children, 
        yet they struggle to provide basic necessities such as education, medication, and food.</li>
      <li>Traditional Systems- Uganda's cultural traditions often place women in secondary roles, leaving them voiceless in family decision-making. 
        In many rural communities, men control resources, leaving women and children to suffer.</li>
      <li>Neglect and Abuse- Alcoholism among men is prevalent, and many rural women are forced to become de facto family heads, 
        managing households alone while battling poverty. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Struggling Families:</b> Most of these women are single-handedly raising
    their families because their husbands are either unemployed, alcohol-
    dependent, or simply absent from their responsibilities.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of Income- Without any form of income-generating activities. Biringo women struggle to provide for their children. School fees
      remain a luxury they cannot afford, leaving their children trapped in the same poverty cycle.</li>
      <li>Educational Barriers- A majority of children in Biringo drop out of school at an early age. This is especially true for girls, 
        who are often forced into early marriages or domestic labor.</li>
    </ul>
