    <p>Rural women are adopting innovative cooking technologies to reduce reliance on firewood and preserve land resources.</p>
    <b>Innovations:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>-Energy-Efficient Stoves: Using less firewood, reducing the pressure on forests. </li>
      <li>Briquettes from Natural Vegetation like wetlands- Currently we are experimenting anaerobic digestion technology with help from the State University of New York at Buffalo. </li>
      <li>This innovation will carbonize the organic matter like papyrus reeds. Biringo women want to create fuel briquettes from renewable resources like papyrus reeds, which are abundant and sustainable in Biringo.</li>
    </ul>
